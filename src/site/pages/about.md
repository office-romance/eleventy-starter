## FAQ

### How does shipping work?

We ship domestic and international orders via USPS. Usually items can be shipped within 1-2 business days. Most unframed prints will be shipped carefully rolled in tube mailers, artwork that cannot be rolled will be shipped flat. Shipping is free within the U.S. and any international shipping should be arranged through email. For an international rate on a specific item please contact [info@lelli.store](mailto:info@lelli.store).

### What is your return policy?

Due to the rare and delicate nature of our artworks, we are unable to accept returns on fine art prints, editions, posters or unique artworks. Extra effort is made to provide accurate photos and list any condition issues in the item descriptions. We do accept book and record returns if there was an error in the listing. To arrange a return please contact [info@lelli.store](mailto:info@lelli.store).

### Where do you source these items and can I request something specific?

We acquire items on the site from many sources, mostly from art collectors and various estates. If you have a specific item that you are trying to source please feel free to contact us, we love requests.
