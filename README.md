A personalised and opinionated starter kit for [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) sites (typically) deployed to Netlify. Inspired by projects like [eleventyone](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone) and [portfolio-starter](https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-starter)

# Opinions

1. Use Tailwind for styling (and cssnano, and autoprefixer)
2. Use Webpack (primarily for hashing static output)
3. Pre-package [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint), [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for better commit messages
